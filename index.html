            <h2>Sleep</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Regular physical activity can promote better sleep. However, avoid being active too close to
                    bedtime.
                    Spending time outside every day might be helpful, too.
                </li>
                <li>Try to resolve your worries or concerns before bedtime. Jot down what's on your mind and then set it
                    aside for tomorrow.
                    Stress management might help. Start with the basics, such as getting organized, setting priorities
                    and delegating tasks.
                    Meditation also can ease anxiety.

                <li>It may be worth buying in bulk to save money, but don't overlook the risks of owning too many of one
                    item,
                    especially perishables, that can expire.
                </li>
                <li>Bartering for goods and services may be unusual for many consumers, but it doesn't hurt to ask.
